<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now studying as a junior student in [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), majoring in Aerospace Engineering. My research interest includes combustion, flame and neural networks, aiming to provide brand-new paradigm for engine design, especially in the reconstructions of flow field in Scramjet, Oblique Detonation Engine (ODE) and Rotating Detonation Engine (RDE).
